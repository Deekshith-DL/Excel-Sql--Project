## Introduction

Pizza, a beloved food item enjoyed by people worldwide, offers a fascinating lens through which to examine consumer behavior and preferences. In this project, we aim to explore pizza sales data, uncover hidden trends, and answer questions related to pizza consumption patterns.

## Dataset

Our dataset contains a comprehensive record of pizza sales, including information about:

- Pizza types and flavors
- Date and time of sale
- Quantity sold per transaction
- Customer demographics (anonymized)
- Sales revenue

The dataset is stored in a SQL database, providing a structured foundation for our analysis.

## Tools Used

We leverage the power of two essential tools for this project:

1. **Excel**: Excel is used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and basic exploratory analysis. It provides a user-friendly interface for initial data manipulation.

2. **SQL**: SQL (Structured Query Language) enables us to extract valuable insights from the dataset. We'll write SQL queries to answer specific questions and perform more advanced analyses.

## Analysis

Our analysis revolves around the following key aspects:

- Identifying the most popular pizza flavors
- Analyzing sales trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Investigating the correlation between customer demographics and flavor preferences
- Exploring upselling opportunities based on transaction history
- Uncovering any seasonality or special event impacts on sales

## Visualizations

Data comes to life through visualizations. We'll create graphs and charts using Excel and other visualization libraries to represent trends and patterns in an easily understandable format.

## Queries

SQL queries are pivotal in extracting meaningful insights from the data. We'll craft SQL queries to:

- Aggregate sales data by flavor, time period, and customer attributes
- Calculate average transaction value
- Identify peak sales periods
- Discover customer segments based on spending behavior
